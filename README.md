This is the Readme for the Magento extension PaymentFilter.

This module enables you to select which payment methods are available for
every customer group. Also, Payment methods can be disabled for specific
products. A customer can only use the payment methods during checkout
available to his customer group AND not disabled for the products in the
shopping cart.

This extension supports Magento 1.3, Magento 1.4 and Magento 1.5.


It was created by Vinai Kopp http://netzarbeiter.com/ for Rico Neitzel
(http://n-punkt.de/).

After installing this extension you have to configure the payment
methods available to each customer group. You do that in the admin interface
under Customers > Customer Groups. The default is NONE, so if you don't do that NO
payment methods will be available and customers will not be able to check out.

The default for products is to allow ALL payment methods, so you only have to configure
the payment methods available to every group. Only change the product level payment method
configuration if you want to disable one or more for a specific products.

The whole extension can be disabled in "System > Config > Sales > Checkout" on a
Global or Website scope.

If you ever uninstall the extension (I don't hope so ;)) your site will be broken, because
Magento doesn't support database updates on uninstalls to remove attributes.

To fix the error, execute the following SQL:

  DELETE FROM eav_attribute WHERE attribute_code = 'product_payment_methods';
  DELETE FROM core_resource WHERE code = 'payfilter_setup';
  ALTER TABLE customer_group 
  DROP allowed_payment_methods;

IMPORTANT! Then clear the magento cache.

This module replaces the extension RicoNeitzel_CGroupPayments that only included
the option to filter by customer groups. That module is no longer continued.
Please install this module instead.

If you have ideas for improvements or find bugs, please send them to vinai@netzarbeiter.com,
with RicoNeitzel_PaymentFilter as part of the subject line.
